# Developer-Assessment
This is a repository for developer assessments.

## Goals
The expectation of this assessment is to challenge your ability to digest our API, and create a result that is a web front end that can be used to sign up, login, logout, and read the current users information.

1. https://securitycamerawarehouse.github.io/Developer-Assessment/
    1. Read through the swagger documentation, if you find any errors please report them to us, we are still working on this.

2. Requirements:
    1. Use the Swagger documentation to create a front end in the language and framework of your choice.
    2. This front end should implement the following API endpoints:
      1. /signup POST - method to signup a user.
      2. /auth POST -  method to authorize a user.
      3. /user/{userName} GET - method to display user information.
      4. /logout/{userName} PUT - method to logout session.
    3. We expect this to be basic, and include a simple form using a front end framework such as (but not only to include) Angular(js), Django, React, Vue etc
